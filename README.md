# crosswordsquares

Have been playing with bananagram tiles with the housemates and decided to write a program to make crosswords squares of letters so that all the columns and rows are english words. Works quickly for 2x2 and 3x3, but slow for larger grids (might try to speed up later). All code in `scrabble.py`.
